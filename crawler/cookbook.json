Moussaka usually consists of eggplant, tomato and ground (or minced) meat baked with bechamel sauce. But there's one small problem. If cut right after baking, the rich layers tend to slide apart. The dish needs time to set and cool. (The word moussaka actually comes from an Arabic word meaning chilled.) In our version, adding pasta sheets in between the layers of sauce and filling eliminates lengthy resting periods, yielding a gorgeous dish straight from the oven.", "calories": 700, "cookTime": -1, "servings": 2}}
